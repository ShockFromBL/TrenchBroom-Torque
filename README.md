# TrenchBroom-Torque

> TrenchBroom is a free (GPLv3+), cross platform level editor for Quake-engine based games. It supports  **Quake**,  **Quake 2**, and  **Hexen 2**  and runs on  **Windows**  (XP and newer),  **Mac OS X**  (10.6 and newer) and  **Linux**. TrenchBroom is easy to use and provides many simple and advanced tools to create complex and interesting levels with ease.

Although this TrenchBroom profile and guide is mainly intended for Blockland, there is no reason why it wouldn't be inherently supported for other Torque games. This is why the profile was called Torque and not Blockland.
